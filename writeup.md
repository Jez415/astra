# Astra — Freestyle Capstone Submission

Track: Freestyle

## One-sentence summary
Astra is a modular multi-agent system that demonstrates parallel and sequential agents, custom tools, long-term memory, observability, and pause/resume long-running operations.

## Problem statement
Modern automation needs small, modular AI agents that can work together, use tools, keep memory, and expose metrics. Astra demonstrates these abilities in a simple, reproducible project.

## Features implemented
- Multi-agent system: Orchestrator + DataAgent + ActionAgent  
- Tools: mock device tool, http stub  
- Memory: SQLite long-term memory + context compaction  
- Observability: logging + Prometheus metrics  
- Long-running operations: background job with pause/resume  
- Agent evaluation: pytest tests
